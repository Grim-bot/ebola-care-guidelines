    <!--RECOMMENDATION DESCRIPTIONS-->

    <string name="bookmarks_help_message">
        "Tap on the buttons below to get specific intervention guides related to this recommendation."
    </string>

    <string name="oral_rehydration_description">
        "Oral rehydration therapy focuses on ensuring actual fluid intake rather than simply the "
        "delivery of an oral rehydration solution. Patients who are too young or ill to prepare "
        "and drink oral rehydration solution independently require active assistance "
        "from health-care providers. Adequacy of oral fluid intake refers to the volume that will "
        "prevent or correct signs of hypovolaemia and should be considered on an individual basis. "
        "This recommendation is unlikely to increase transmission of Ebola virus to health workers."
    </string>

    <string name="parenteral_fluids_description">
        "Parenteral administration of fluids is recommended to patients who are unable to drink or "
        "who have inadequate oral intake to keep up with current volume losses. Options for "
        "parenteral fluid administration include peripheral and central intravenous or intra-osseous "
        "routes. Enteral fluids via nasogastric tube could be an acceptable alternative for selected "
        "patients (eg, children with difficult intravenous access with adequate gastrointestinal "
        "motility, mild to moderate volume depletion, and tolerance of a nasogastric tube), and with "
        "sufficient provider technical skill."
    </string>

    <string name="monitoring_vitals_description">
        "Monitoring and documentation of vital signs to detect hypovolaemia and early warning signs "
        "of poor outcomes might reduce mortality and are unlikely to increase transmission of Ebola "
        "virus to health workers. Vital signs are components of the physical examination that can "
        "ascertain volume status (ie, heart rate, blood pressure, gastrointestinal fluid loss, urine "
        "output, and, in children, capillary refill, skin pinch, and tears), as well as mental status, "
        "respiratory rate, oxygen saturation, and temperature."
    </string>

    <string name="serum_biochemistry_description">
        "Measuring and charting serum biochemistry with a clinically relevant correction of abnormalities "
        "might reduce mortality. This intervention could result in a small increase in the risk for "
        "Ebola virus transmission to health workers. Whenever possible, biochemistry tests should be "
        "consolidated with Ebola virus testing and with blood sampled via an existing intravenous line "
        "or needles with safety features to minimise the risk of needle-stick injury. In addition to "
        "the expected survival benefits associated with treatment of severe biochemical abnormalities, "
        "the intervention could reduce iatrogenic deaths caused by inappropriate administration of "
        "electrolytes (eg, potassium in acute renal failure), and brain oedema associated with rapid "
        "correction of hypernatraemia with hypotonic solutions."
    </string>

    <string name="staffing_ratio_description">
        "Increased clinician-to-patient ratios probably reduce mortality. The effect on the risk of "
        "Ebola virus transmission is unknown. The term clinician encompasses nurses, clinical officers, "
        "and physicians. In practice, clinicians work with a partner or team in the isolation zone "
        "to ensure adherence to appropriate IPC practices. The minimum recommended clinician:patient "
        "ratio is an average (eg, could vary within Ebola treatment units on the basis of clinical "
        "severity). The clinical contact time likely influences care more than staffing ratios per se. "
        "Monitoring of patients can be facilitated by Ebola treatment unit design and technology. "
        "Non-clinician health workers can support clinical staff (eg, to assist in administration of "
        "oral rehydration solution)."
    </string>

    <string name="communication_description">
        "Facilitating the communication of isolated patients with family and friends, including enabling "
        "the use of cell phones or the internet, might reduce psychological distress and can be achieved "
        "without increasing the risk of Ebola virus transmission. Closer contact situations, including "
        "burials, can be safe if appropriate IPC practices, such as use of physical barriers, are employed."
    </string>

    <string name="medicines_description">
        "Analgesic therapy reduces pain. With the available evidence, it was not possible to assess "
        "whether non-steroidal anti-inflammatory analgesics (particularly those that inhibit cyclooxygenase-1) "
        "should be avoided because of anti-platelet effects or risks of acute kidney injury in the "
        "setting of Ebola virus disease. Additional medications may be needed depending upon the "
        "patient's clinical presentation. These include:\n"
        "* Antipyretic agents (eg, acetaminophen, paracetamol) to decrease fever associated with Ebola "
        "virus disease. Dose reduction of these agents may be needed for patients with progressive hepatic dysfunction. "
        "As already mentioned, non-steroidal antiÂ­inflammatory agents are generally avoided to help minimize the risk of renal failure.\n"
        "* Antiemetic medications to control nausea and vomiting.\n"
        "* Antimotility agents (eg, loperamide) to control diarrhea and decrease fluid and electrolyte losses.\n"
        "* AntiÂ­epileptic medications for those with seizures."
    </string>

    <string name="antimalarials_antibiotics_description">
        "Ebola virus disease patients may require evaluation and/or treatment of other concomitant "
        "or possible infections (eg, malaria). In addition, empiric antimicrobial treatment should be "
        "administered to patients with clinical evidence of bacterial sepsis, which may be a late complication"
        "The choice of agent should provide adequate coverage for gramÂ­negative pathogens. "
        "Empiric gramÂ­positive therapy should be added in certain patients, such as those with "
        "hospitalÂ­acquired pneumonia or indwelling central venous catheters.\n"
        "Antibiotic use can increase antibiotic resistance. However, the degree of antibiotic use we "
        "recommend for the management of patients during an Ebola virus disease outbreak probably "
        "represents a negligible increase in the overall use of antibiotics, and it is therefore unlikely "
        "to have a significant effect on antibiotic resistance."
    </string>

    <string name="blood_transfusion_description">
        "Blood products (eg, packed red blood cells, platelets, fresh frozen plasma) may be needed "
        "for patients with coagulopathy and bleeding."
    </string>

    <string name="parenteral_nutrition_description">
        "Total parenteral nutrition support may be needed for individuals with poor oral intake who "
        "are unable to tolerate a moderate- to high-calorie diet."
    </string>

    <string name="renal_replacement_description">
        "Renal replacement therapy may be needed to manage severe multifactorial acute kidney injury. "
        "If dialysis is required, clinicians should refer to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention "
        "(CDC) document on how to safely perform acute hemodialysis in patients with Ebola virus disease."
    </string>

    <string name="respiratory_support_description">
        "Invasive mechanical ventilation (intubation) may be the best option for patients with "
        "progressive respiratory failure. When considering the management of such patients with Ebola "
        "virus disease, clinicians should recognize that some types of respiratory support present "
        "a hazard of generating infectious aerosols. The use of noninvasive mechanical ventilation "
        "or highÂ­flow oxygen therapy (eg, Vapotherm) is generally not recommended given the potential "
        "for continuous aerosol production."
    </string>

    <string name="pregnancy_care_description">
        "Ebola virus disease is associated with a high risk of fetal death and pregnancyÂ­associated "
        "hemorrhage. The CDC and the American College of Obstetrics and Gynecology have issued recommendations "
        "for the care of pregnant women with Ebola virus disease. However, there are no data to suggest "
        "whether cesarean or vaginal delivery is preferred or when the baby should be delivered. Thus, "
        "decisions regarding obstetrical care must be made on a caseÂ­byÂ­case basis."
