## Public repository for the Ebola IMC prognostic models and care guidelines mobile app

This repository contains the model-derivation scripts and the source code of the Ebola Care Guidelines app, described in the manuscript "Machine learning and mHealth techniques to improve prognostication and clinical management of patients with Ebola virus disease" by Colubri et al. 

The manuscript is available as a [pre-print on bioRxiv](http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/294587), and the app can be freely installed on any Android device from [Google Play Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.broadinstitute.ebola_care_guidelines).

Check the readme file under the models folder for directions on how to run the model-generation Jupyter scripts, and the wiki for an in-depth guide on how to adapt the source code of the Ebola Care Guidelines app to update the models, guidelines, and even adapt it to a different disease.
