## Ebola Care Guidelines app

This app offers evidence-based guidelines for the care and management for Ebola Virus Disease (EVD) patients. It also uses machine learning prognostic models to the calculate severity risk of a patient at triage based on the demographics information, clinical signs and symptoms, and laboratory results.

The manuscript describing the prognostic models in the app is available as a [pre-print on bioRxiv](http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/294587), and the app itself can be freely installed on any Android device from [Google Play Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.broadinstitute.ebola_care_guidelines).
