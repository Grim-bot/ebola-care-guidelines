# Ebola Care Guidelines app

This app offers evidence-based guidelines for the care and management for Ebola Virus Disease (EVD) patients. It also incorporates machine learning prognostic models to calculate the severity risk of a patient at triage based on the demographics information, clinical signs and symptoms, and available laboratory results. The manuscript describing the prognostic models is available as a [pre-print on bioRxiv](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/294587v5), and the app itself can be freely installed on any Android device from [Google Play Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.broadinstitute.ebola_care_guidelines). 

The sections below provide an overview of the app's functionality, and the [wiki section](https://github.com/broadinstitute/ebola-care-guidelines/wiki) describes how to customize the app with new models and guidelines.
